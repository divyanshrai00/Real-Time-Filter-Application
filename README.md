# Real-Time-Filter-Application
Implemented a Real Time Filter Application using Python
Used opencv, tkinter and numpy libraries to build this GUI of filter
It includes filters like Threshold, Laplace, Delta, Sobel, Bilateral, Blue, Gray, Sepia and Negative

You can run the python code in any IDE preferably Jupyter notebook or Spyder
If you don't have python installed then you can also run the RTFA application (.exe file)
