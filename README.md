# Real-Time-Filter-Application
Implemented a Real Time Filter Application using Python
Used opencv, tkinter and numpy libraries to build this GUI of filter
It includes filters like Threshold, Laplace, Delta, Sobel, Bilateral, Blue, Gray, Sepia and Negative

You can run the python code in any IDE preferably Jupyter notebook or Spyder

When you apply filter and press snap dat button then the picture is clicked and saved into a folder named "Snap" in the same location where you are running the code
