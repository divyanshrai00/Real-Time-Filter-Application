# Real-Time-Filter-Application
Implemented a Real Time Filter Application using Python
Used opencv, tkinter and numpy libraries to build this GUI of filter
It includes filters like Threshold, Laplace, Delta, Sobel, Bilateral, Blue, Gray, Sepia and Negative

You can run the python code in any IDE preferably Jupyter notebook or Spyder

Even if you don't have any python IDE installed in your laptop or PC, you can download the application file (.exe) from the drive link shared below

When you apply filter and press snap dat button then the picture is clicked and saved into a folder named "Snap" in the same location where you are running the code

This is how the filter application looks. The image shown has gray filter applied.
